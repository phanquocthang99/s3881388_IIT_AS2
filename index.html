<h2 style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Overview</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Due to the Covid-19
pandemic, several games have become popular with people during the quarantine.
For example, Among Us, Fall Guys, and the newest game that has been discussed
widely at this time-Play Together. Those games have some similar features: they
are casual social-network games, a vast variety of people play them at a time,
and the number of players plummeted after a period of time. Learning from their
failure, I decided to develop a game that is based on the Unity platform that
can draw attention to gamers and maintain a stable number of players over time.</span></p>

<h2 style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Motivation</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In 2020, there was a big
change in the game industry. While people were getting bored with
action-adventure games with hyper-realistic graphics, the wave of casual
social-network games was a new taste for them to experience. However, these
games could not keep players long enough because of the lack of evolution after
the number of downloads broke the record. For example, Among Us on Steam shows
that there were only 271 players maximum at a time in January 2020, and the
number of players rose rapidly to 438,524 players maximum in September 2020,
but there were 17,040 peak players left in the last 30 days. The reason is all
about their in-game content. The developers have not changed anything much
since they created this game (no new mode, no event, no competition, etc.). The
players will soon realize there isn’t any goal for them to achieve in this game
after a while. The motivation for me to create a new game is to satisfy myself
and a group of players who are expecting a rich-content social-network game.
And by using Unity, I can create a game that has good design, smooth animation,
and can be released on many platforms to attract players.</span></p>

<h2 style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Description</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Here are various features
that must include in the game:</span></p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Tutorial stage:</span>
     <span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Although
     this is a casual game (players can perform actions easily), players need a
     guide to get used to its functions to have a better experience. Thus,
     tutorial stages will be set up first for every new player, and they will
     get some rewards after finishing each stage.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In-app purchase:
     There should be a store for players to buy extra items, additional
     content, or they can exchange money for the game’s currency. This is a
     free-to-play game, so the main profit that a developer can gain from this
     game is by selling items from the store.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Micro-phone: One of
     the largest obstacles in social-network games is communication, since
     players have to type anything they want to say. I understand that a group
     of players can use another platform like Discord to communicate, but I
     want to create a virtual world where any player can talk to others.
     Therefore, I’m going to put microphone features in the game.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>User interface:</span><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
     My goal is to design an interface that is as simple as possible. On the
     start screen, there should be start, setting, and announcement buttons.
     Next, the in-game user interface will include buttons in the left corner
     of the screen to perform necessary functions, like customizing characters,
     settings, friend list, missions, turning on/off voice chat,... etc.
     Moreover, all of them will be simplified by icon in order not to take too
     much space on the screen.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Friend system: This
     is a social-network casual game, and its main goal is to connect people
     together. Therefore, I especially focus on the friend system. Accounts
     that have already been added together as friends can increase their
     relationship points by doing tasks, and when they reach a certain point,
     they can open some special functions.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ranking system: </span><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What
     keeps players from getting bored is the competitive nature of the game.
     There will be an in-game chart button that displays the rank of the top
     players, who have achievement points above other players. Besides that,
     every player will be given their rank depending on their points, so they
     can keep their gaming process on track.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Loot box system:
     This is a type of gambling that allows players to spend in-game money to
     receive a random item, and I put this system in because I understand that
     one of the most addictive features for players is gambling. By using the
     Random Number Generator (RNG) system, various types of loot boxes can be
     created (Open mystery boxes, draw cards,...). There is an area being
     created where players can test their luck to get unique items or special
     characters, and those can not be traded. This feature arouses the desire

<span style='color:#252525;background:white'>The&nbsp;Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence
state of the art is&nbsp;Deep Learning. According to Antonio Otsuni, he
describes: &quot;Deep learning takes inspiration from the activity of neurons
within the brain to learn how to recognize complex patterns through learned
data.&quot; That means Deep Learning allows&nbsp;machines&nbsp;to&nbsp;have
the&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;things by their sound or
image.&nbsp;Based&nbsp;on Deep Learning, people are developing a&nbsp;technology&nbsp;that
can cure various critical eye diseases by recreating a&nbsp;detailed&nbsp;3D
form of an eye and&nbsp;examining&nbsp;its&nbsp;symptoms. At present,
Artificial Intelligence has been applied in many&nbsp;departments,&nbsp;from
the&nbsp;Health Care&nbsp;Service, to the&nbsp;Military,&nbsp;to human&nbsp;daily
life. For example, AI has been&nbsp;applied&nbsp;to medical&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;that&nbsp;allows&nbsp;doctors
to detect cancer&nbsp;in&nbsp;any patient at their earliest stage, or the
pilotless aircraft has been fully operated by Artificial Intelligence which
is&nbsp;used&nbsp;in warfare, or the simpliest thing&nbsp;is,&nbsp;the face
recognization technology that has been applied to our&nbsp;smartphones&nbsp;is
also based on AI. Moreover, the navigation&nbsp;applications&nbsp;such as
&quot;Google Map&quot; which are intergrated into
the&nbsp;smartphones&nbsp;also&nbsp;use&nbsp;Artificial Technology to make&nbsp;predictions
about&nbsp;the road status, and people will know which&nbsp;routes&nbsp;are
heavy or light at that time. We are living in the computer era, and I can see
that Artificial Intelligence has been developed and updated day by day.
So&nbsp;many&nbsp;possibilities&nbsp;will appear in the next 3 years to benefit
human&nbsp;life.&nbsp;Firstly,&nbsp;handicapped people can be
equipped&nbsp;with&nbsp;alternate parts that will have implemented advanced AI,
so this AI will allow&nbsp;them&nbsp;to&nbsp;feel&nbsp;like their real body and
perform tasks like a normal person..&nbsp;To make this technology possible, IT
scientists need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;deeper&nbsp;research&nbsp;to
improve&nbsp;machines’&nbsp;intelligence in order to merge
both&nbsp;humans&nbsp;and&nbsp;machines&nbsp;into one. Furthermore, people are
trying to develop&nbsp;real-time translating applications. This application
allows any&nbsp;person&nbsp;with any language&nbsp;to&nbsp;communicate with
each other in their native language because the AI will detect your voice and
language and&nbsp;translate it&nbsp;into the language you want. At present,
some similar applications&nbsp;have been&nbsp;released, but they have not
worked&nbsp;effectively.&nbsp;Therefore, I expect that 3 years is enough time
for them to complete this application, and it can suppress the language gap
between people around the world. This application will need
time&nbsp;from&nbsp;a combination of IT developers
and&nbsp;linguists&nbsp;since they are trying to expand the vocabulary storage
for it.</span></span></p>

that I expect from Artificial Intelligence is its ability to improve the

all the services that are operated by humans at the moment. For example, many
places will no longer employ people as security as machines will undertake that
by scanning residents’ faces, voices, or fingerprints to authorize their
personality. Invaders will not have any chance to sneak into a building that is
fully protected by AI. Moreover, the health care services can also apply
Artificial Intelligence technology. With the development of AI, it can identify
any errors in your body status and make a diagnosis of your illness quickly and
correctly. The development of Artificial Intelligence is inevitable, and it
comes with both advantages and disadvantages. Human life will be extended due
to the development of AI in the health care system, and some devices in your
house will be operated by AI, so you will barely do anything in the future.
However, It will cause unemployment for a large number of workers around the
world because the machines will do their jobs, and this could lead to a global
crisis.</span></p>

a virtual assistant, so I will have a more comfortable life and have more time

Intelligence will be applied to almost all transportation, so it will allow
transportation to detect and avoid objects automatically. Therefore, the
requirements for operating transportation will be lower, and I can even operate
a heavy shuttle or ambulance if we are in an emergency situation. Artificial
Intelligence will also change my parents’ lives drastically. My parents are
plant lovers, so they have a passion for planting flowers and trees. However, they
have a problem is that they ca measure the dosage of water and fertilizer
perfectly for each plant. In the future, AI will undertake this mission, as
they can recognize each type of plant, collect data from many sources to give
out the appropriate solution to take care of them, and my parents will no

<h2>Cloud computing</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What does it do?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There are three types of
cloud computing state of the art: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a
Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). People can choose any
type of these forms depending on their purpose. SaaS is a distribution model
for software. Instead of downloading software to run locally on a personal
computer, the program or application is hosted by a third-party vendor and then
accessed. SaaS applications are also known as web-based software, on-demand
software, and hosted software. PaaS type provides users with the platform to
develop their program, software, or website, and since it does not require any
special or specific environment for the application, users can work on it
conveniently. The last thing is the IaaS type. This technology gives users the
key to access virtual resources, including online infrastructures, servers,
software,... etc. The most specific instance of cloud computing that is being
used widely in the world is email. Any email platform at present applies cloud
computing technology as users can store and access files on those online
platforms. Another use of cloud computing technology is for education. Teachers
at RMIT University are using a platform called Canvas to deliver course
lectures, materials, assignments, and syllabuses to students, and either
students or lecturers can participate in the discussion forum. In the future,
people are expecting that they can develop games based on cloud computing
technology, and that will be a new face of the game industry. In the near
future (about 3 years), games based on Cloud Computing technology will be
released by many game companies. Their goal of applying Cloud Computing to
games is to lower the system requirements for any game that they have
developed. By applying Cloud Computing, players can run a game on a created
server remotely while the image of that game is displayed directly on their
devices. This will expand the number of people who can join the game because
they don’t need to update their devices to the latest to experience it. To make
it possible, companies such as Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft need to design a
cloud server for their games and introduce them widely to players all over the
world. Moreover, as these Cloud Computing game types will allow players to run them
on a remote server, a strong internet connection is required, and developers
expect that at least the speed of 5G is enough to run them smoothly.</span></p>

line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The evolution of Cloud
Computing will impact many industries in the world, and one potential impact
that I can predict is tourism. Cloud Computing technology has made it easier
for travel agencies to operate. Web-based travel search, smartphone, chatbot,
data analytics, and travel ERP &amp; CRM tools have reduced manual and time-consuming
tasks for those assisting with procedures and planning for their customers. By
the development of this technology, both businesses and customers are impacted
the most. Firstly, it helps travel agencies lower their funds required to
operate a website. The tourism industry is very competitive. Demand may spike
during seasonal or holidays and also bottom out at times. When you invest in an
on-premise infrastructure, you are required to spend a fair amount of money
initially on storage and processing when demand is high, and then, if customer
demand changes, you also have to accept that you don't really need that amount
of bandwidth. Cloud computing is a pay-on-demand service. As demand grows, the
number of servers and storage can easily increase. As the traffic decreases,
the configuration decreases and so does the price. When sharing data or making
online payments, we are extremely vulnerable to identity theft. Many consumers
are concerned about this. While the internal infrastructure is already safe, IT
teams are constantly looking for methods to enhance it in order to resist the
current threats, and these additional services are typically costly. Cloud
computing providers, on the other hand, are constantly updating their security
to secure their infrastructure.</span></p>

study whenever I need. Moreover, storing various files and projects was a big
problem in the past. It is very easy for me to lose files because any error on
my hard drive can lead to losing everything. Cloud Computing technology allows
me to store files online by using some platforms like Google Drive, Google Doc,
One Drive, etc. Those applications are fully secured by the IT teams, so my
files will not be stolen or sabotaged easily. Cloud Computing improves my
ability to communicate with teammates, and vice versa. By using Github, we can
share and commit our codes directly together. Furthermore, the Discord platform
allows us to deliver and store files on it, and we can also hold virtual
meetings on this platform.</span></p>

Since Masa doesn’t mention any challenges to becoming a game programmer in the

release. This is not only a challenge, but the game programmer can also gain
more programming experience while they work with these prototypes.</span></p>
